Hello, Welcome to hearing clinic datavase systems beta package
First, go into the database implementation and add in your database name in the fill marker
Go into the java program and change the username and password if you change databases
This is a beta, several procedures have not yet been added or tested. 
The system is currently able to read and insert, delete, and update data, just not display the data.
Please run the program in a java compiler.

-Team15, its the best we could do.
